INSTALLATION GUIDE - A-1J Skyraider

Extract all the files into your CFS2 or FS2002 root folder. The necessary sub-folders will be created automatically. CFS2 weapons are in a seperate zip and these have to be installed *seperately*. Just extract the weapons zipfile straight into the root of CFS2 and everything will go where it should.



CFS2 USERS :

1) Note on CFS2 WEAPONS - Install these from the seperate zipfile.

2) Note on CFS2 'Virtual Tailhook': pressing shift-g will lower the CFS2 tailhook. Please not that this has nothing to do with the visible tailhook, which is lowered at the full flaps setting, F8. With the virtual tailhook down, you will be able to use the arrestor wires on suitably-equipped carriers.
